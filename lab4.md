Lab 4 - Vim interfacing 
===

For this weeks lab report, I will be recording my exact keyboard inputs to complete a set of tasks from this week's lab.

For clarity, everything that I type in the terminal will be in inline code, and everything enclosed by a `<>` is a specific key / command done with one keyboard input

1 . Log into ieng6
---

In the terminal, I did the following inputs consecutively: `ssh cs15lsp23fx@ucsd.edu <enter>`, and then I entered my password, which I will not write out for this lab, and then I pressed `<enter>`
